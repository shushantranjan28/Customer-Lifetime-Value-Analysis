# Customer Acquisition Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of customer acquisition data to gain insights into the performance of different marketing channels. The dataset contains information on customer acquisition costs, conversion rates, and revenues from various marketing channels, including referral, paid advertising, email marketing, and social media.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze the effectiveness of each marketing channel in terms of cost, conversion rate, and return on investment (ROI). Additionally, the project aims to identify which channels are driving the highest customer lifetime value (CLTV) and which ones need optimization.

## Data Overview
The dataset consists of 800 rows and 5 columns, with each row representing a unique customer acquisition entry. The columns include:
- **customer_id:** A unique identifier for each customer acquisition record.
- **channel:** The marketing channel through which the customer was acquired (e.g., referral, paid advertising, email marketing, social media).
- **cost:** The acquisition cost associated with each channel.
- **conversion_rate:** The conversion rate of customers acquired through each channel.
- **revenue:** The revenue generated from customers acquired through each channel.

## Analysis and Visualizations
1. **Distribution of Acquisition Cost:** Visualized the distribution of acquisition costs across all channels using a histogram, providing an overview of cost patterns.
2. **Distribution of Revenue:** Created another histogram to visualize the distribution of revenue across different marketing channels.
3. **Customer Acquisition Cost by Channel:** Compared the acquisition costs of different channels using a bar plot to display the average cost for each marketing channel.
4. **Conversion Rate by Channel:** Used a bar plot to present the conversion rates of each marketing channel, helping identify high-performing channels.
5. **Total Revenue by Channel:** Utilized a pie chart to illustrate the percentage distribution of total revenue generated by each marketing channel.
6. **Return on Investment (ROI) by Channel:** Calculated ROI and used a bar plot to analyze the efficiency of each channel in terms of generating revenue relative to acquisition costs.
7. **Customer Lifetime Value by Channel:** Calculated the customer lifetime value for each channel and visualized it using a bar plot, identifying the most valuable channels in terms of long-term customer relationships.
8. **CLTV Distribution by Channel:** Used a box plot to visualize the distribution of CLTV within each channel, helping to understand its spread.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the performance of various marketing channels, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions regarding resource allocation and channel optimization. By identifying high-performing channels and understanding customer lifetime value, businesses can focus on strategies that yield the best returns on their marketing investments.

Through this project, I demonstrated my proficiency in data analysis, data visualization, and the ability to draw actionable conclusions from marketing data.
